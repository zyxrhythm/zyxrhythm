<strong>Why "zyxrhythm"?</strong>

<b>Z</b>, <b>Y</b>, and <b>X</b> are the letters in a 3D coordinate system. (just saying, but this does not really directly answer the question. XP)



The real answer:

There are only 3 things that exists.
1. 'it' [X]
2. not 'it' [Y]
3. the line in between 1 & 2 [Z]
These 3 things are everywhere, if you see more or less than 3, you might want to look again.

There are but 3 things that determines the future of 'it'.
1. potential [X]
2. will [Y]
3. chances [Z]

<b>Rhythm</b> is symmetry/"timed movement through space"/pattern/relation/interaction/interconnection/flow/...

ZYX Rhythm is a way of looking at reality. 
Arguably it is reality itself.
It is like a visual map of everything!
Helps me understand how all are connected and how all are divided.



<b>Why ZYX and not XYZ?</b>
The arrangement is not really relevant to what it wants to convey.

But maybe because... back then our mentors taught us to start with A then B then C...
what happens when you reach ...XYZ?  We "<< back | track ". 

Or there is nothing special about the arrangement and I just want to start with Z.

**The song on the video link above is Burn It Down by Linkin Park**

**Below are the lyrics of the song to support my belief and make you believe:**
<pre>
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames, climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
